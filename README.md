# Java Unit Testing Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools: A Slidev Presentation

This repository contains a slide deck created using the Slidev presentation tool. The presentation covers 15 Java testing frameworks, libraries, and tools, and was built for my presentation as an intern at ChatChatABC, Davao City, Philippines. Each slide has thorough presenter notes that can be viewed in the **slides.md** file or through presenter view.

## Topic Outline

The slide deck covers the following topics:
1. Difference between a **testing framework**, a **testing library**, and a **testing tool**.
2. The main features of the following testing frameworks, libraries, and tools:
    - JUnit 5
    - JUnit Pioneer
